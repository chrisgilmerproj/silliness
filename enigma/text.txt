The most common arrangement used a ratchet and pawl mechanism. 
Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and, every time a key was pressed, each 
of the pawls corresponding to a particular rotor would move forward in unison, 
trying to engage with a ratchet, thus stepping the attached rotor once. A thin 
metal ring attached to each rotor upon which the pawl rode normally prevented 
this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would 
eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to drop into position, engage 
with the ratchet, and advance the rotor. The first rotor, having no previous 
rotor (and therefore no notched ring controlling a pawl), stepped with every 
key press. The five basic rotors (I-V) had one notch each, while the additional 
naval rotors VI, VII and VIII had two notches. The position of the notch on each 
rotor was determined by the letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to 
the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they 
caused the next wheel to move were as follows
