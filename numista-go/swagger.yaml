  description:
    Numista provides a REST API to access the numismatic catalogue and collection data programmatically.
    The functionalities include coin search, coin identification by image, coin pricing, and coin collection management.

      The API is available at `https://api.numista.com/v3`. For example, the data about the 1 thaler coin from the 
      Free imperial city of Mühlhausen (N# 95420) can be retrieved at `https://api.numista.com/v3/types/95420`
      
      ```bash
      curl -X GET "https://api.numista.com/v3/types/95420" \
      -H "Numista-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
      ```

      An example Python script is available here: [numista_api_example.py](https://en.numista.com/api/doc/numista_api_example.py).
      The script intends to illustrate how to use the Numista API. It is not suitable for direct use in real applications.

    description: |
      ## API key
      All requests to the Numista API should include your API key in a HTTP header named "Numista-API-Key".
      
      `Numista-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY`
      
      ## User authentication
      Some endpoints allow access to the personal data of a Numista user. In order to use these endpoints, you need to 
      get authorization from the user via the OAuth 2.0 protocol (see below) to get a temporary access token.
      The OAuth access token should be provided as a bearer token in the HTTP header named "Authorization"
      
      `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
      
      Two types of OAuth authentication are available: authorization code and client credentials.
      
      ### Authorization code
      The first step consists in redirecting the user to the page  `https://{language}.numista.com/api/oauth_authorize.php?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scope}&state={state}`

      where:
      - `{language}` is the 2-letter language code ('en', 'es' or 'fr')
      - `{client_id}` is the client ID which was assigned to your application and provided together with your API key.
      - `{redirect_uri}` URI to redirect back the user to your application after they authenticate.
      - `{scope}` is a comma-separated list of permissions you are requesting (e.g. 'view_collection').
      - `{state}` is a value of your choice, which will be echoed in the redirection back to the redirect URI.

      On that page, the user will be prompted whether they allow your application to get the requested permissions. 
      If the user is successfully authenticated and grant the authorization, they will be redirected back to the 
      redirect URI you provided with the following elements in the query string:
      - `code`: the authorization code
      - `state`: the same state value as your provided previously

      Your application should verify that the returned value for "state" matches the value sent in the redirection.


      In a second step, you can exchange the authorization code for an access token by calling the endpoint `/oauth_token` 
      described below with the following parameters:
      - `grant_type` is "authorization_code".
      - `code` is the code you received in the query string of the back redirection described above.
      - `client_id` is the client ID which was assigned to your application and provided together with your API key.
      - `client_secret` is your API key.
      - `redirect_uri` is the redirection URI you specified for the step described above.

      ### Client credentials
      To authenticate to your own account, you can call directly the endpoint `/oauth_token` described below, 
      with the following parameters:
      - `grant_type` is "client_credentials".
      - `scope` is a comma-separated list of permissions you are requesting (e.g. 'view_collection').

      description: |
        In order to access the data of a Numista user, you will need to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
        See the section "Authentication" above.
        
        
        Two types of authentications are available: authorization code and client credentials.
        
        
        For the "authoriation code" flow, call the endpoint `/oauth_token` with the following parameters:
        - `grant_type` is "authorization_code".
        - `code` is the code you received in the query string of the back redirection described above.
        - `client_id` is the client ID which was assigned to your application and provided together with your API key.
        - `client_secret` is your API key.
        - `redirect_uri` is the redirection URI you specified for the step described above.
        
        
        For the "client credentials" flow, call the endpoint `/oauth_token` with the following parameters:
        - `grant_type` is "client_credentials".
        - `scope` is a comma-separated list of permissions you are requesting (e.g. 'view_collection').

        You may use the resulting access token for all subsequent API calls which need user authentication. 
        The access token should be provided in the HTTP header of the subsequent API calls according the following model:
        
        `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
        
        
        The access token has a limited validity period. The lifetime of the access token is indicated in the response of the API.
